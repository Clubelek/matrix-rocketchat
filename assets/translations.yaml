      Hi, I'm the Rocket.Chat application service

      You have to connect this room to a Rocket.Chat server.

      **Connect to a new server**

      Open the Administration section of your Rocket.Chat server, select Integrations --> New Integration --> Outgoing WebHook with the following settings:

      * Enabled: true
      * URLs: ${as_url}/rocketchat

      There is a Token which we will need for the connection, copy it and press Save Changes to create a webhook.

      Now you can connect the server by sending a message in this room:

      `connect rocketchaturl token`

      The `rocketchaturl` is the URL where your Rocket.Chat server is running and `token` is the token from the webhook you just created.
      *It is highly recommended that you use https to connect to your Rocket.Chat server.*

      A sample message could look like this:

      `connect https://chat.example.com z44cwkD86P5PmdkEv7nHX7KB`
    login_instructions: |
      You are connected to ${rocketchat_url}.

      You have to login before you can use the application service, there are two ways to do that:

      1. Send a message in this room: `login rocketchatusername mysecret`
      **Warning**: This will store your password *unecrypted* in the database of your homeserver

      1. Login via curl: `curl AS_URL/login -d '{"rocketchat_server_url": "${rocketchat_url}", "matrix_user_id": "${matrix_user_id}", "username": "rocketchat_user", "password": "mysecret"}'`
