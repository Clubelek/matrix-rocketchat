      Hi, I'm the Rocket.Chat application service

      You have to connect this room to a Rocket.Chat server.

      **Connect to a new server**

      Open the Administration section of your Rocket.Chat server, select Integrations --> New Integration --> Outgoing WebHook with the following settings:

      * Enabled: true
      * URLs: ${as_url}/rocketchat

      There is a Token which we will need for the connection, copy it and press Save Changes to create a webhook.

      Now you can connect the server by sending a message in this room:

      `connect rocketchaturl token`

      The `rocketchaturl` is the URL where your Rocket.Chat server is running and `token` is the token from the webhook you just created.
      *It is highly recommended that you use https to connect to your Rocket.Chat server.*

      A sample message could look like this:

      `connect https://chat.example.com z44cwkD86P5PmdkEv7nHX7KB`
    too_many_members_in_room: "Admin rooms must only contain the user that invites the bot. Too many members in the room, leaving."
    other_user_joined: "Another user join the admin room, leaving, please create a new admin room."
  defaults:
    admin_room_display_name: "Admin Room (Rocket.Chat)"
    internal_error: "An internal error occurred"
  handlers:
    welcome: "Your Rocket.Chat <-> Matrix application service is running"
  errors:
    internal: "An internal error occurred"
